# SnapForge – A Photo Sharing and Editing Platform

## 📌 Project Overview
SnapForge is a mini-project that allows users to upload, edit, and share photos easily.  
Along with the application, we are implementing DevOps practices such as version control, CI/CD, containerization, cloud deployment, and monitoring.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop a responsive photo-sharing and editing web app.
- Automate build, testing, and deployment with a CI/CD pipeline.
- Containerize the app using Docker.
- Deploy on AWS EC2 for accessibility.
- Monitor the app with Prometheus and Grafana.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, CSS
- **Version Control:** GitHub
- **CI/CD:** CircleCI
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Cloud:** AWS EC2
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus + Grafana

## 🚀 Roadmap
1. Set up repo and version control ✅
2. Configure initial CI/CD pipeline
3. Build frontend features (upload, edit, share)
4. Containerize app with Docker
5. Deploy on AWS EC2
6. Add monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana
